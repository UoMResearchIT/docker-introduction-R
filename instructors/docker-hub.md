# Docker Hub

Is there anything else we could do?
Let's look at the docs... but where?


## Introducing the Docker Hub
Docs live in Dockerhub, a container image repository.  
You do not *need* dockerhub to be able to docker.

Open your web browser to https://hub.docker.com  
In the search bar type “spuc” and hit enter.  
Select the spuacv/spuc container image.

**Top:** Name, endorsements, creator, a short description, tags, and popularity

**Top-right:** command to pull.

**Two tabs:**
- Overview - contains the documentation.
- Tags - contains the list of versions, indicated by “tags”.

Name structure:
`OWNER/REPOSITORY:TAG`

Click the version tag for latest of this image to "inspect".

**Note:** The latest tag is not always the most recent version of the software.  
Tags are actually just labels, and the latest tag is just a convention.


## Official images
In the search box, type “python” and hit enter.
The “official” badge is shown on the top of the repository.


## Choosing Container Images on Docker Hub
- Updated regularly.
- Established company, community...
- Dockerfile or other.
- Good documentation.
- Use by the wider community. The graph on the right at the search page can help with this.


## Other sources of Container Images

- GHCR from Github.
- Quay from Red Hat.
- Artifact Registry from Google.
- GLR from GitLab.
- ECR from Amazon.
- ACR from Azure, Microsoft.
